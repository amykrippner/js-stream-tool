# 🎨 js - JavaScript Stream Tool 

**Transform your terminal into a JavaScript playground!**  
*Powerful text processing with method chaining, colors, and JavaScript magic*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**js** is a command-line utility that brings the full power of JavaScript's method chaining directly to your text streams. Pipe any text through **js** and unleash JavaScript's native array and string methods — with added superpowers!

Instead of memorizing complex sed/awk patterns, just write JavaScript you already know! Plus, we've supercharged it with custom methods and color capabilities.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Option 1: Global npm Installation (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g js-stream-tool
```

### Option 2: Install Directly from GitHub
```bash
npm install -g sayore/js-stream-tool
```

### Option 3: Local Installation
```bash
npm install js-stream-tool
```

Then use with `npx`:
```bash
echo "hello world" | npx js '.toUpperCase()'
```

### Option 4: Manual Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sayore/js-stream-tool.git
cd js-stream-tool
npm install
```

---

## ⚡ Usage

The syntax is simple and intuitive:

```bash
<command> | js '<chain>'
```

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- **Your chain MUST start with a `.`** (like `.toUpperCase()`)
- **Use single quotes** for the chain to avoid shell interpretation
- **Use double quotes** inside for strings: `js '.includes("text")'`

---

## 🔥 Quick Examples

```bash
# Uppercase conversion
echo "hello world" | js '.toUpperCase()'

# Filter lines containing specific text
ls -l | js '.includes(".txt")'

# Add color to output
echo "error" | js '.color("red")'

# Combine operations
echo "hello world" | js '.toUpperCase().color("green")'

# Extract specific parts
echo "name,age,city" | js '.split(",").get(0)'
```

## 📚 Understanding Differences

This tool works differently from regular JavaScript. Important behavioral differences, common pitfalls, and best practices are covered in [DIFFERENCES.md](./DIFFERENCES.md).

---

## 🎨 Colors & Formatting

Add vibrant ANSI colors to your output:

**Available Colors:**
- Basic: `red`, `green`, `blue`, `yellow`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `white`, etc.
- Bright: `brightRed`, `brightGreen`, etc.
- Background: `bgRed`, `bgBlue`, etc.
- Styles: `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, etc.

For color examples, see [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md).

---

## 🧩 Chain Composition

Save and reuse complex operations:

```bash
# Save a complex chain
js -s upper-red '.toUpperCase().color("red")'

# Use the saved chain
echo "hello" | js '$upper-red'
```
